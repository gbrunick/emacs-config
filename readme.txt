This project exists to give me an easy way to keep my emacs configuration
files in sync.

Everything in this project is copywrite Gerard Brunick 2013 to the extent
that it can be.


Current Bugs:

gpb-logging - the broken indentation.

gpb-python - problems with locations of errors in compilation-shell-minor
             mode in ipython buffers.

gpb-settings - gpb-settings:make-settings-buffer should be a macro
               gpb-settings:defun.

post `gpb-jedi:xml-rpc-method-call-async' to bazaar cite for xml-rpc.
